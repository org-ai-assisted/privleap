#   broad-exception-caught: except blocks are intended to catch all possible
#     exceptions in each instance to ensure the process exits with a special

#   invalid-name: pylint seems to be mis-detecting some of our variables as
#     constants. This silences those warnings.

"""shim.py - PAM integration shim for privleap. This exists to allow privleap
actions to integrate seamlessly with PAM, allowing each action to have
environment variables and umask customized by PAM without conflicting with other
actions that may be starting simultaneously. Originally this logic was
implemented as part of privleapd itself, but because umask changes are applied
at the process level (not the thread level), PAM was modifying the umask for
privleapd as a whole, which could cause issues. This shim provides a layer of
separation between privleapd and PAM."""

## Scrub the variables systemd's service manager injects into privleapd for
## its own use (the sd_notify, socket-activation, and watchdog protocols).
## They are meaningless to an action and grant it a capability it should not
## have: an action runs in privleapd's cgroup, so NOTIFY_SOCKET would let it
## talk to the manager's notify socket, LISTEN_FDS would hand it privleapd's
## activation file descriptors, and WATCHDOG_* would let it pet the service
## watchdog. systemd's NotifyAccess=main already rejects notifications from a
## non-main PID, so this is defence in depth rather than a fix for an
## exploitable bug; it also keeps actions from inheriting a confusing,
## privleapd-specific environment. This removes only the manager-injected
## protocol variables, NOT any PAM-provided variables (those remain trusted,
## see agents/guidelines.md).
